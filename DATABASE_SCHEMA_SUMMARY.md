# BioAttend Database Schema Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully created all database models matching the ERD requirements with automatic timestamps, soft delete functionality, and proper uniqueness constraints.

## Models Created

### 1. Base Models (common app)
- **TimestampedModel**: Abstract model with `created_at` and `updated_at` fields
- **SoftDeletableModel**: Abstract model with `is_deleted` and `deleted_at` fields
- **BaseModel**: Combines both mixins for use by all models

### 2. User Model (authentication app)
- Already existing custom user model
- Fields: id (UUID), email, first_name, last_name, role (ADMIN/STUDENT/FACULTY)
- Serves as the base for Student and Faculty relationships

### 3. StudentGroup Model (students app)
- Represents student groups/classes
- Unique constraints: name, code, and combination of (name, academic_year, semester)
- Fields: name, code, description, academic_year, semester

### 4. Student Model (students app)
- One-to-one relationship with User (role=STUDENT)
- Foreign key to StudentGroup
- Unique constraint: student_id
- Status tracking: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, GRADUATED, SUSPENDED, WITHDRAWN

### 5. Faculty Model (faculty app)
- One-to-one relationship with User (role=FACULTY)
- Unique constraint: faculty_id
- Designation types: PROFESSOR, ASSOCIATE_PROFESSOR, ASSISTANT_PROFESSOR, LECTURER, TEACHING_ASSISTANT
- Status tracking: ACTIVE, INACTIVE, ON_LEAVE, RETIRED

### 6. Schedule Model (schedules app)
- Links courses to student groups and faculty
- Unique constraints prevent:
  - Double-booking of rooms: (student_group, weekday, start_time, room, effective_from)
  - Faculty conflicts: (faculty, weekday, start_time, effective_from)
- Time-based effectiveness with effective_from and effective_until dates

### 7. AttendanceLog Model (attendance app)
- Tracks student attendance for scheduled classes
- Unique constraint: (student, schedule, date) - prevents duplicate entries
- Facial recognition support: face_recognition_confidence, face_image_path
- Manual override capability with audit trail
- Status types: PRESENT, ABSENT, LATE, EXCUSED

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Automatic Timestamps**: All models inherit `created_at` and `updated_at` fields that update automatically

2. **Soft Delete**: All models have soft delete functionality with `is_deleted` flag and `deleted_at` timestamp

3. **Proper Indexing**: 
   - All foreign keys are indexed
   - Frequently queried fields have indexes (status, is_deleted, etc.)
   - Unique fields are indexed

4. **Data Validation**:
   - Schedule model validates end_time > start_time
   - AttendanceLog validates check_out_time > check_in_time
   - Proper date range validation

5. **Referential Integrity**:
   - CASCADE delete for user relationships
   - PROTECT delete for student groups (prevents accidental deletion)
   - SET_NULL for audit fields

## Migrations
- All migrations have been generated successfully
- Migration files created for: common, students, faculty, schedules, attendance apps
- Ready to be applied when database is available

## Visualization
- Created model visualization diagram (models_diagram.png)
- Shows all models, fields, and relationships
- Generated using Graphviz

## Next Steps
When database is available:
1. Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply migrations
2. Create admin interfaces for model management
3. Implement model managers for soft-delete queries
4. Add model serializers for API endpoints
